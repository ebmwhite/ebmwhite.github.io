## Recall our State Population Data: 

```{r}
pop.url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_and_territories_of_the_United_States_by_population"

pop.data <- pop.url %>%
  read_html() %>%
  html_nodes("table") %>%
  .[[3]] %>%
  html_table()

#only columns we need
pop.data <- pop.data[,c(1:3,10)]
#Rename column 1
colnames(pop.data)[1] <- "NAME"
#rename Column 3
colnames(pop.data)[3] <- "Population"
#Remove all commas in numbers
pop.data$Population <- str_replace_all(pop.data$Population, ",", "")
#Convert these to numbers
pop.data$Population <- as.numeric(pop.data$Population)
#rename Column 4
colnames(pop.data)[4] <- "GeographicSort"
#only rows we need
pop.data <- pop.data %>% 
  filter(GeographicSort != "Terr.")
```

Let's preview the data: 
```{r}
head(pop.data)
```

Suppose we wanted to create a map with data. We would need to combine together our map data with our population data. 
```{r}
#recall our states map data from the maps package
library(maps)
states_map <- map_data("state")
```

In order to create a plot with both the population data AND the map, we will need to combine the two datasets together.

There should be some column which the two datasets have in common (the "key")

```{r}
#the joins functions are in the dplyr package 
#you should already have it installed when you installed the tidyverse package
population_map <- left_join(states_map, pop.data, by = c("region"="NAME"))
```

Whoops! It didn't work. Why not? 

`states_map` has the state names (`region`) with all lowercase letters and `pop.data` has the first letter of the state names (`NAME`) capitalized. 

It's easy to fix this using the `tolower()` function. 
```{r}
pop.data$NAME <- tolower(pop.data$NAME)
```

Let's try re-running our code again: 

```{r}
population_map <- left_join(states_map, pop.data, by = c("region"="NAME"))
```

It worked! Check out the data. 

```{r}
head(population_map)
```


```{r}
# Create the map
ggplot(population_map, aes(long, lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(fill = Population), color = "black") +
  coord_fixed(ratio = 1)+
  theme_light() + 
  ggtitle("USA, Population by State")
```


# Left, Right, Inner and Outer Joins

Did you notice that `pop.data` had additional values under `NAME` (like west and south atlantic ) that weren't a part of `map_data`? Where did they go? 

We used a left join. This means that we keep all the values in for state names from the left table `map_data` and if there is a match from the `pop.data` it gets added. 

Below is a nice visualization of left, right, inner, and outer joins.

There are other kinds of joins (`semi_join()`, `full_join()`, etc.) if you want to learn more about them. 

This URL provides some really nice demonstrations of all kinds of joins in R: (https://stat545.com/join-cheatsheet.html)[https://stat545.com/join-cheatsheet.html]

# Common Issues with Joining

- duplicate keys
- lowercase/uppercase 
- symbols or whitespace
- Make sure the join fields are the same format.
