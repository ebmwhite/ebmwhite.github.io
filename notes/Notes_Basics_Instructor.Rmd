# Getting Set-up

## Installing and Setting up RStudio

The R console looks like this: 

![](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/692f3658d35df168276cf46e3e083f908a5cc105/f7707/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/rstudio-windows.png)

## File Organization

Make sure that you set up a folder for this class. 

## Using RMarkdown/knitr

You can *knit* the file. The first time you do this you will need to make sure you have the `knitr` package installed. You have the option to knit into `.html`, `.pdf`, and `.doc`. In general, in this course we will be knitting into `.html`. 

## RMarkdown formatting 

To make something "code-looking" we use the grave accent ` found in the upper left of your keyboard. 

To create a header, place a hash tag at the start of the line. For example, `# Header 1` or create a level 2 header using `## Header Level 2`. 

To make text italics put asterisk around the text `*like this*`. To make text bold, put two asterisks around the text `**like this**`. 

To make a list, just start creating your list using a `-` or `*` for each bullet, like this: 

```{r eval=F}
- list item 1
- list item 2
```

It is important that there is a blank line before the first bullet.  

Add a link with the follwing code: 

`[Alt text that will display](www.google.com)`

It will display like this: 

[Alt text that will display](www.google.com)

Add an image with the following code: 

`![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/master/rstats-artwork/rmarkdown_wizards.png)`

It will display like this: 

![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/master/rstats-artwork/rmarkdown_wizards.png)

The vast majority of markdown syntax are available in the [RStudio RMarkdown Cheatsheet, Section 3](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf). 

## R Chunks 

Create an R chunk: 

```{r}
2+2
```

OR

```{r}
x<-4
``` 

`echo=T` or `echo=F`-- determines whether or not to echo the source code in the output file. This can be useful if you are creating a document for someone to read that doesn't need to see or doesn't want to see you code, just the output. In general in this course for assignments I would like your code to be echoed. The default is `echo=F`. 

`results=T` or `results=F` -- determines whether or not the results will be displayed. This can be useful if you want to show code, but don't care what the output is. The default is `eval=T`.

`eval=T` or `eval=F` -- determines whether or not to evaluate the code. This can be useful if you have a whole chunk of code you don't want run, but you also don't want to. The default is `eval=T`.

There are many, many more options including `fig.width`, `fig.height`, `cache`, etc. The vast majority of options are available in the [RStudio RMarkdown Cheatsheet, Section 5](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf). 

You have the option to set the options individually on each chunk and/or set the global options by using the code `knitr::opts_chunk$set(your options here))` in the first code chunk. 

## Inline Code

Rather than using a code chunk (which is centered in the middle of the page), you also have to options to use inline code. You can place the following within any sentence or paragraph. 

```{r eval=F}
`r codehere`
```

For example, 

```{r eval=F}
This is the number `r x`.
```

becomes... This is the number `r x`.


## Installing Packages

Packages can contain lots of things including: data sets, functions, etc.

You can install packages using the packages tab or you can use the code `install.packages('packageyouwant')` in the console. 

In each new R session where you want to use the package you will have to load it by typing `library('packageyouwant')` in the console (or in the RMarkdown document - more later). 

To get help with a package (or a function in a package) you can type `?packagename` into the console.

# Some Basic R code

## Variables, Calculations, Vectors

Assigning Variables: 

```{r}
x<-56
```

Calculations: 

```{r}
y <- x*2 #multiply
          # note that because value is assigned to y, it won't print out
y #prints out the value of y
x/2 #divide
x^2 #x to the power of 2
```


Vectors: 

```{r}
# c() function: concatenate
heights <- c(67, 100, 34, 78, 80)
```

Referencing Elements of a Vector:

```{r}
heights[3]
```

Adding to Vectors:

```{r}
heights <- c(heights, 90)
heights
```

## Importing  Data

From a file on your computer: 

```{r}
airbnb <- read.csv("NYCairbnb2019.csv")
```

From the web: 

```{r}
library("openintro")
cars
```

For now, we will mostly be working with `.csv` and `.xls` files. Later in the course, we may discuss other types of files. 

## Basics for Working with a Dataframe

Assessing Size:

```{r}
# dim() spits out dimensions of a dataframe
dim(airbnb)
```

Names: 

```{r eval=FALSE}
# names() spits out column names of a dataframe
names(airbnb)
```

Referencing Columns: 

```{r eval=F}
airbnb$latitude
airbnb[,3]
airbnb[,"latitude"]


attach(airbnb)
latitude
```

Calculations: 

```{r}
mean(airbnb$price)
median(airbnb$price)
sd(airbnb$price) #standard deviation
```

```{r}
# calculates the mean price, broken down by neighbourhood group
tapply(airbnb$price, airbnb$neighbourhood_group, mean)

#calculates the mean price, broken down by room type
tapply(airbnb$price, airbnb$room_type, mean)
```

Conditional Subsetting: 

```{r}
# prints out all the rows where the price is more than 8000
airbnb[airbnb$price >= 8000,]
```

```{r eval=F}
# prints out all the rows where the neighbourhood group is Manhattan
# note the double equal sign
airbnb[airbnb$neighbourhood_group=="Manhattan",]
```

## Basic Plotting

```{r}
hist(airbnb$price)
plot(airbnb$reviews_per_month, airbnb$price)
```


```{r}
plot(cars$mpgCity, cars$weight)
boxplot(cars$mpgCity ~ cars$type)
```

```{r}
table(cars$type)
barplot(table(cars$type))

```

# Best Practices 

## Commenting

- Be sure to comment your code (in R, use a `#` before a line of comment)
- The more descriptive you can be the easier it will be for other to read (and for you to read later)

## Naming

When naming variables, observations, data frames, or files, make them: 

- meaningful 
- consistent
- concise 
- code and coder friendly 

Other naming considerations: 

- avoid names that are common/used function names (ie. `filter` or `mean`)
- consider making object names nouns, and function names verbs
- it's not the end of the world if you give something a bad name, but it will save you (and others) time and effort down the road
- avoid formatting and symbols (ie. spaces or \&)
- keep a clear record of your variable names as well as longer descriptions including units (ie. `surface_temp`= surface temperature measurement on Mars in degrees Celsius)

## Entering Things 

Some suggestions for best practices: 

- be consistent (ie. `purple` vs. `Purple` vs. `purple_`)
- put any additional information such as units or notes in a column separate from the value
- if there is missing entries, enter the name thing for each missing value (it is common to use `NA`, `NaN`, `-9999`, `-`); don't leave cells blank
- if data is abbreviated, make a record somewhere of how the what they mean

# The Basics of Working with Missing Data

Missing data are usually in the data as `NA`, `NaN`, `N/A`, or `-9999`. When doing operators on numbers, most functions will return `NA` if the data includes missing values. 

```{r}
mean(airbnb$reviews_per_month)
```

```{r}
# use arguement na.rm to remove NAs
mean(airbnb$reviews_per_month, na.rm=T)

#OR 

# use function na.omit() to return a vector without NAs, then take the mean
mean(na.omit(airbnb$reviews_per_month))
```


# Working with Factors

Factors are used to represent categorical data. Factors can be ordered or unordered and are an important class for statistical analysis and plotting. 

```{r}
#to check whether something is a factor
is.factor(cars$type)
```

```{r}
# to make something a factor
cars$type <- factor(cars$type)
```


Once created, factors can only contain a pre-defined set values, known as levels. By default, R always sorts levels in alphabetical order. 

```{r}
#to see the levels
levels(cars$type)

#to see the number of levels
nlevels(cars$type)

table(cars$type)
```


```{r}
#to change the order or to give order
cars$type <- factor(cars$type, levels = c("small", "midsize", "large"), ordered=T)

min(cars$type)
```

Note that if you only want to plot two of the factors (say small and midsize cars). 

```{r}
boxplot(cars$mpgCity~cars$type)
```
